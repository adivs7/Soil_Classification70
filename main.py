    Welcome to the Soil Recognition System! üåøüîç
    
    Our mission is to help in identifying Soil type efficiently. Upload an image of the soil, and our system will analyze it to detect the soil type.

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Soil Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential Soil category.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate results.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Soil Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Soil Recognition System!

    ### About Us
    Learn more about the project, our team, and our goals on the **About** page.

                #### About Dataset
                This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset.The original dataset can be found on this github repo.
                This dataset consists of about 8K rgb images of various types of soil which is categorized into 8 different classes.The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
    
                #### Content
                1. train (5098 images)
                2. test (2979 images)
